      Vincent van Gogh
    </h1>

    <div class="text-black text-[25px] font-bold mb-12 text-justify">
      Vincent Willem van Gogh was a Dutch Post-Impressionist painter who is among the most famous and influential
      figures in the history of Western art. In just over a decade, he created approximately 2,100 artworks, 
      including around 860 oil paintings, most of them in the last two years of his life. His works include landscapes, 
      still lifes, portraits, and self-portraits, most of which are characterised by bold colours and dramatic brushwork
      that contributed to the rise of expressionism in modern art.

        What first drew me to Van Gogh was how different he was from the art trends of his time. While most artists 
        were focused on realism and making paintings look almost like photographs, Van Gogh wasn’t afraid to be 
        bold and experimental. His visible brushstrokes, unusual color choices, and emotional intensity made his 
        work stand out in a way that felt raw and personal. Though many people of his time found this style 
        unappealing or even strange, those very qualities are now celebrated as his signature and what makes 
        his art timeless. His use of thick, swirling brushstrokes, exaggerated forms, and unexpected colors gave his
        work a kind of emotional depth that realism couldn’t capture. A night sky, for instance, wasn’t just black 
        with stars—it became a restless swirl of blues and yellows that seemed alive. Fields weren’t just landscapes
        they vibrated with energy and movement.

      ~ Early life ~
    </h3>
    <div class="text-black text-[25px] font-bold mb-12 text-justify">
      Vincent was sensitive and introspective from a young age. He struggled with school and often felt isolated. As a teenager,
      he worked at the art dealership Goupil & Cie, gaining exposure to the art world but facing repeated professional 
      setbacks. Hoping to follow in his father’s footsteps, he later pursued religious work and became a lay preacher 
      in Belgium’s Borinage region, though he ultimately failed to formalize a career in ministry. Vincent also 
      experienced early romantic disappointments: he was rejected by Eugénie Loyer and later tried to care for Sien
      Hoornik, a pregnant woman in difficult circumstances, but that relationship could not endure. Throughout these
      struggles, his close bond with his brother Theo, who offered constant support and encouragement, remained a 
      stabilizing force. These personal and professional challenges—loneliness, unfulfilled love, career frustration,
      and spiritual searching—shaped Van Gogh’s emotional depth and would later inform the intensity, empathy, and
      passion of his art.

        Vincent van Gogh struggled with severe mental health issues throughout his life, including anxiety, depression,
        and recurring episodes of psychosis. These struggles were exacerbated by isolation, unfulfilled ambitions, and
        personal hardships, including failed relationships. In December 1888, during a period of intense stress and
        conflict with fellow artist Paul Gauguin in Arles, Van Gogh suffered a mental breakdown and cut off part of his 
        left ear, which he reportedly wrapped and gave it to Sien Hoornik, an act that shocked those around 
        him and marked a turning point in his life. Following this incident, he was hospitalized multiple times
        and continued to experience bouts of psychological instability.

        Vincent van Gogh's death on July 29, 1890, has long been accepted as a suicide, but recent theories suggest
        otherwise. According to the widely accepted narrative, Van Gogh shot himself in a wheat field near 
        Auvers-sur-Oise, France, and died two days later from the wound. However, this account has been challenged 
        by some historians and researchers. For instance, a 2014 Vanity Fair article proposed that Van Gogh may have 
        been accidentally shot by René Secrétan, a local teenager who had previously bullied him. This theory points 
        to inconsistencies in the suicide narrative, such as the absence of a proper suicide note, upbeat letters 
        indicating future plans, and the lack of witnesses. Additionally, forensic analysis by Dr. Vincent Di Maio
        backed the claim that Van Gogh's wounds were unlikely self-inflicted.
